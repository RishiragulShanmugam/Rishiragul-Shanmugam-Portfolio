                                Fuzzy Mathematics is the branch of mathematics including fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic 
                                that deals with partial inclusion of elements in a set on a spectrum. As opposed to simple binary
                                ”yes” or “no” (0 or 1) inclusion. Looking back to the history of sciences.it seems that fuzzy sets 
                                were bound to appear at some point in the 20th century. It started in 1965 after the publication of 
                                lotfi asker Zadeh’s seminal work fuzzy sets. Linguistics is an example of a field that utilize fuzzy 
                                set theory.

                                In 1975, Rosenfeld considered fuzzy relations on fuzzy sets. He developed the theory of 
                                fuzzy graphs. Bang and Yeh during the same time introduced various connectedness concepts in 
                                fuzzy graphs. Inexact information is used in expressing or describing human behaviors and mental

                                expression of fuzzy relation and thus the fuzzy graph is frequently expressed in fuzzy matrix.

                                Fuzzy Mathematics is the branch of mathematics including fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic that deals 
                                with partial inclusion of elements in a set on a spectrum. As opposed to simple binary ”yes” or “no” 
                                (0 or 1) inclusion. Looking back to the history of sciences.it seems that fuzzy sets were bound to appear 
                                at some point in the 20th century. It started in 1965 after the publication of lotfi asker Zadeh’s seminal

                                In 1975, Rosenfeld considered fuzzy relations on fuzzy sets. He developed the theory of fuzzy graphs. 
                                Bang and Yeh during the same time introduced various connectedness concepts in fuzzy graphs.

                                Graph theory has many applications in solving various problems of several domains, including networking, 
                                communication, data mining, clustering, image capturing, image segmentation, planning, and scheduling. 
                                However, in some situations, certain aspects of a graphtheoretical system may be uncertain. 
                                Use of fuzzy-graphical methods in dealing with ambiguity and vague notions is very natural. 
                                Fuzzy-graph theory has a large number of applications in modeling various real-time systems where the level 
                                of information inherent in the system varies with different levels of precision. In this internship activities, 
                                we have presented a new framework to handle fuzzy information by combining fuzzy sets with graph structures. 
                                We have introduced many basic notions concerning fuzzy-graph structures including maximal product of two 
                                fuzzygraph structures and regular fuzzy-graph structures, and investigated a few related properties. 
                                We have also defined the degree and total degree of vertex in the maximal product of fuzzy-graph structures, 
                                and discussed some properties with examples.

                                Placing navigation at the bottom makes it easily accessible with thumbs. 
                                Bottom navigation bars help declutter the top navigation area. 
                                It Will reduce the Space of the Apps or Websites.
                                Provides a clear and consistent navigation pattern.

                                Too many navigation items can lead to user confusion so try to avoid too many icons in a single page because 
                                Inconsistent design can make the app look unprofessional.Failing to provide feedback on active navigation 
                                items can cause user frustration. It's Just a Sample Project so i Used 7 Sections  with 7 Icons. 
                                Bottom navigation bars are commonly used in mobile apps. It Can be used in web applications, 
                                especially those with a mobile-first design approach. 3-5 navigation items are ideal to avoid clutter. 
                                Icons help reduce language barriers and save space so I Used Icons only Mode. 
                                If Wanted We can Use text labels for icons to improve accessibility. To Know Where we are Highlight the active navigation item.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Tapping on an icon takes the user to the associated destination. The icon that the user is currently 
                                viewing is highlighted. Use a bottom navigation bar when an app has three to five top-level destinations. 
                                It's a well-known feature in Android applications, and is used in many apps like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You can customize the look and feel of the bottom navigation bar. For example, you can change the size of 
                                the icons, or make the selected item appear different from the unselected items.
                                To implement a bottom navigation bar in an Android app, you can use Android's Material Design Library.
