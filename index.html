                                were bound to appear at some point in the 20th century. It started in 1965 after the publication of

                                In 1975, Rosenfeld considered fuzzy relations on fuzzy sets. He developed the theory of 
                                fuzzy graphs. Bang and Yeh during the same time introduced various connectedness concepts in 
                                fuzzy graphs. Inexact information is used in expressing or describing human behaviors and mental 
                                process. The information depends upon a person subjectively and it is difficult to process 
                                objectively. Fuzzy information can be analyzed by using a fuzzy graph. Fuzzy graph is an 
                                expression of fuzzy relation and thus the fuzzy graph is frequently expressed in fuzzy matrix.

                                in 2016, connected domination in fuzzy graphs. K.R. Sandeep Narayan and M.S.Sunitha in 2012,
                                Connectively in fuzzy graphs and its complement. In 1965, Lofi A. Zadeh introduced the concept 
                                of a fuzzy subset of a set as the method for representing the phenomena of uncertainty in real life 
                                situations. Azriel rosenfeld introduced fuzzy graphs in 1975. Alison northup introduced
                                semiregular graph is also called as (2,k)– regular graph and studied some properties of (2,k)-regular

                                N.R.Santhi Maheswari and C.Sekar introduced d2 of a vertex in graph and also discussed

                                introduced.(2,k)–regular fuzzy graphs and totally (2,k)-regular fuzzy graphs are compared through 
                                various examples. Sampathkumar introduced the notion of graph structures. Graph structures are 
                                the generalization of graphs and widely useful in the study of some structures, like graphs, signed 
                                graphs, semigraphs, edge-colored graphs, and edge-labeled graphs. Dinesh introduced the concept 
                                of fuzzy-graph structures and described some related concepts. Fuzzy-graph structures are more 
                                useful than graph structures because they deal with the uncertainty and ambiguity of many real 
                                world phenomena. Ramakrishnan and Dinesh worked on generalized fuzzy-graph structures. 
                                Harinath and Lavanya discussed fuzzy graph structures for wheel, helm, and star graphs.

                                on d2 of a vertex in in graph and introduced (r,2,k)–regular graph and also discussed some properties 
                                of (r,2,k)– regular graph.in this paper we define d2 degree of a vertex in fuzzy graphs and total d2 –degree 
                                of a vertex in fuzzy graphs and (2,k)–regular fuzzy graphs are introduced.(2,k)–regular fuzzy graphs and 
                                totally (2,k)-regular fuzzy graphs are compared through various examples. Sampathkumar introduced the notion 
                                of graph structures. Graph structures are the generalization of graphs and widely useful in the study of 
                                some structures, like graphs, signed graphs, semigraphs, edge-colored graphs, and edge-labeled graphs. 
                                Dinesh introduced the concept of fuzzy-graph structures and described some related concepts. 
                                Fuzzy-graph structures are more useful than graph structures because they deal with the uncertainty and 
                                ambiguity of many realworld phenomena. Ramakrishnan and Dinesh worked on generalized fuzzy-graph structures. 
                                Harinath and Lavanya discussed fuzzy graph structures for wheel, helm, and star graphs.

                                Graph theory has many applications in solving various problems of several domains, including networking, 
                                communication, data mining, clustering, image capturing, image segmentation, planning, and scheduling. 
                                However, in some situations, certain aspects of a graphtheoretical system may be uncertain. 
                                Use of fuzzy-graphical methods in dealing with ambiguity and vague notions is very natural. 
                                Fuzzy-graph theory has a large number of applications in modeling various real-time systems where the level 
                                of information inherent in the system varies with different levels of precision. In this internship activities, 
                                we have presented a new framework to handle fuzzy information by combining fuzzy sets with graph structures. 
                                We have introduced many basic notions concerning fuzzy-graph structures including maximal product of two 
                                fuzzygraph structures and regular fuzzy-graph structures, and investigated a few related properties. 
                                We have also defined the degree and total degree of vertex in the maximal product of fuzzy-graph structures, 
                                and discussed some properties with examples.

                                Placing navigation at the bottom makes it easily accessible with thumbs. 
                                Bottom navigation bars help declutter the top navigation area. 
                                It Will reduce the Space of the Apps or Websites.
                                Provides a clear and consistent navigation pattern.

                                Too many navigation items can lead to user confusion so try to avoid too many icons in a single page because 
                                Inconsistent design can make the app look unprofessional.Failing to provide feedback on active navigation 
                                items can cause user frustration. It's Just a Sample Project so i Used 7 Sections  with 7 Icons. 
                                Bottom navigation bars are commonly used in mobile apps. It Can be used in web applications, 
                                especially those with a mobile-first design approach. 3-5 navigation items are ideal to avoid clutter. 
                                Icons help reduce language barriers and save space so I Used Icons only Mode. 
                                If Wanted We can Use text labels for icons to improve accessibility. To Know Where we are Highlight the active navigation item.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Tapping on an icon takes the user to the associated destination. The icon that the user is currently 
                                viewing is highlighted. Use a bottom navigation bar when an app has three to five top-level destinations. 
                                It's a well-known feature in Android applications, and is used in many apps like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You can customize the look and feel of the bottom navigation bar. For example, you can change the size of 
                                the icons, or make the selected item appear different from the unselected items.
                                To implement a bottom navigation bar in an Android app, you can use Android's Material Design Library.

                                In 1975, Rosenfeld considered fuzzy relations on fuzzy sets. He developed the theory of 
                                fuzzy graphs. Bang and Yeh during the same time introduced various connectedness concepts in 
                                fuzzy graphs. Inexact information is used in expressing or describing human behaviors and mental 
                                process. The information depends upon a person subjectively and it is difficult to process 
                                objectively. Fuzzy information can be analyzed by using a fuzzy graph. Fuzzy graph is an 
                                expression of fuzzy relation and thus the fuzzy graph is frequently expressed in fuzzy matrix.

                                N.R.Santhi Maheswari and C.Sekar introduced d2 of a vertex in graph and also discussed 
                                some properties on d2 of a vertex in in graph and introduced (r,2,k)–regular graph and also 
                                discussed some properties of (r,2,k)– regular graph.in this paper we define d2 degree of a vertex in 
                                fuzzy graphs and total d2 –degree of a vertex in fuzzy graphs and (2,k)–regular fuzzy graphs are 
                                introduced.(2,k)–regular fuzzy graphs and totally (2,k)-regular fuzzy graphs are compared through

                                graphs, semigraphs, edge-colored graphs, and edge-labeled graphs. Dinesh introduced the concept 
                                of fuzzy-graph structures and described some related concepts. Fuzzy-graph structures are more 
                                useful than graph structures because they deal with the uncertainty and ambiguity of many real 
                                world phenomena. Ramakrishnan and Dinesh worked on generalized fuzzy-graph structures. 
                                Harinath and Lavanya discussed fuzzy graph structures for wheel, helm, and star graphs.
